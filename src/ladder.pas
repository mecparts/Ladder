  Ladder: a reimplementation in Turbo Pascal of the classic 
  CP/M game "Ladder", originally written by Yahoo Software (not 
  Yahoo!).

  Ladder is an ASCII character based platform arcade game similar to 
  Donkey Kong. You travel through levels with platforms and ladders 
  where rocks fall down from the top while you collect statues 
  before reaching the exit.
